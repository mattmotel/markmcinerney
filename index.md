I am a Visiting Assistant Professor at Wesleyan University. I completed my PhD in economics at the University of Connecticut in 2019. I conduct research in the areas of Health Economics, Applied Microeconomics and Labor Economics. My research focuses on public policy, health services and how they affect health outcomes. Primarily, I have focused on health outcomes related to the opioid epidemic.
