Many responses to the opioid epidemic have focused on the supply of prescription opioids. Two recent papers (Alpert et al., 2018, Evans et al., 2018) have documented how the reformulation (creation of an abuse deterrent formula) of OxyContin led to substitution among opioid users from prescription opioids to illicit heroin. In this study, I examine how reformulation of prescription opioids has impacted rates of viral infection including HIV and Viral Hepatitis.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Working Paper.

This study examines the impact of expanded health insurance coverage, resulting from the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, on opioid related mortality. I utilize variation in states’ decisions to expand Medicaid, in the timing of expansion and in the pre-policy uninsured rate at the state and county level. Opioid related mortality data are examined from 1999-2016 using the multiple cause of death files obtained from the Centers for Disease Control. My findings suggest the implementation of Medicaid expansion resulted in about a 30% reduction in heroin deaths, a 26% reduction in other unspecified narcotics deaths and a 14.5% increase in methadone related deaths. My study builds on recent work that shows increases in prescriptions to treat opioid use disorder in expanding states relative to non-expanding states.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Revise and Resubmit, Journal of Policy Analysis and Management.
