This study examines the impact of expanded health insurance coverage, resulting from the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, on opioid related mortality. I utilize variation in statesâ€™ decisions to expand Medicaid, in the timing of expansion and in the pre-policy uninsured rate at the state and county level. Opioid related mortality data are examined from 1999-2016 using the multiple cause of death files obtained from the Centers for Disease Control. My findings suggest the implementation of Medicaid expansion resulted in about a 30% reduction in heroin deaths, a 26% reduction in other unspecified narcotics deaths and a 14.5% increase in methadone related deaths. My study builds on recent work that shows increases in prescriptions to treat opioid use disorder in expanding states relative to non-expanding states.
