*Working Paper*. Along with the many deaths that have been attributed to opioid overdose and the substantial economic impact of the epidemic, the increasing prevalence of opioid use disorder has been associated with new viral infections. Powell et al. (2019) find that states with higher prevalence of OxyContin misuse prior to the introduction of abuse-deterrent OxyContin experienced substantially higher growth in the hepatitis C infection rate since 2010. In this study, I find that increases in hepatitis C infections have coincided with increases in hepatitis B infections in states with higher rates of OxyContin misuse prior to the introduction of abuse-deterrent OxyContin in 2010. I apply this analytical framework to HIV infections but face data limitations.
