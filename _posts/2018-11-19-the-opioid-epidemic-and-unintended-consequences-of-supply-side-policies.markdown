*Working Paper*. Many responses to the opioid epidemic have focused on the supply of prescription opioids. Two recent papers (Alpert et al., 2018, Evans et al., 2018) have documented how the reformulation (creation of an abuse deterrent formula) of OxyContin led to substitution among opioid users from prescription opioids to illicit heroin. In this study, I examine how reformulation of prescription opioids has impacted rates of viral infection including HIV and Viral Hepatitis.
